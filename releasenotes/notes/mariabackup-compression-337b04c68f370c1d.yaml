features:

    Adds optional compression for backups created with mariabackup. Adds two
    new CLI parameters to the mariabackup script that are used to enable
    compression and to choose a compression tool.

    * ``--compress=True|False``
    * ``--compressor=<compressor>``

    Also introduces new Ansible variables that control the above mentioned
    parameters.

    * ``galera_mariadb_backups_compress``
    * ``galera_mariadb_backups_compressor``

    Each backup archive is stored in a dedicated directory, alongside the
    backup metadata.
upgrade:
  - |
    Backup compression is disabled by default, so no changes need to be made
    for existing deployments. Should compression be desired, set
    ``galera_mariadb_backups_compress`` to ``True``. Choose a compression tool
    with ``galera_mariadb_backups_compressor``, default is ``gzip``.
others:
  - |
    Compressed backups cannot be prepared in advance, this step must be
    manually carried out by the user before importing it into MariaDB.
